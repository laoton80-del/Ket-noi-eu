# VIONA Kernel + Handoff — Fast Safe Global Mode

**Document type:** Canonical kernel and session handoff for VIONA engineering, product, and AI agents.
**Audience:** New ChatGPT / Cursor windows, staff, contractors, and automation executors.
**Baseline:** `origin/master @ 64ccd56` — `docs(requests): record Pack15C execution readiness decision (#82)`
**Supersedes for Request Engine sequencing:** prior scattered pack pointers when this doc conflicts on pack order or blocked state — align to this handoff.
**Subordinate to:** `docs/ai-context/VIONA_OPERATING_PROTOCOL.md` and founder-signed **Master Blueprint** (`VIONA_FINAL_MASTER_BLUEPRINT_V2.md`). If conflict, stop and report drift risk.

## 1. Strategy

### VIONA Fast Safe Global Mode

VIONA advances as a **global AI action platform** for Vietnamese abroad and Vietnamese merchants overseas — not a single-vertical demo. **Fast Safe Global Mode** means:

- **Fast:** Cursor executes allowed work end-to-end (branch, inspect, edit allowlist, gates, commit, push, report) without waiting for human keystrokes on safe lanes.
- **Safe:** Critical path stays gated; no fake production, no DB apply, no live money/SOS/AI without explicit pack approval.
- **Global:** All universes belong in the product vision; internal labels (Lite / Pilot / Gated / Beta) control **what may be claimed now**, not whether a market or universe is in scope.

### Pipeline hóa VIONA

Request Engine and platform work move in **numbered packs** with human approval packets where required. Each pack has:

- explicit allowlist (files that may change)
- gate scripts that must PASS
- evidence README
- blocked list until the next approved pack

No pack may skip ahead on the critical path.

### Gate Factory

After Pack14C migration-file creation, many gate scripts duplicated Pack14C migration SQL allowlist logic. **Pack14D Gate Factory** (`scripts/lib/vionaPackDiffAllowlist.mjs`) centralizes that logic to **reduce repeated gate allowlist drift** and legacy false positives while **preserving gate semantics**.

### Cursor-first execution law

See §2 — Cursor is the default executor for safe, allowlisted work; ChatGPT owns direction and approval boundaries.

### Parallel low-risk lanes

UI polish, docs/specs, AI product contracts, GTM/business docs, i18n/safety copy, country launch matrix, and consent / do-not-call / audit policies may run **in parallel** when they do not touch forbidden paths or weaken gates.

### Critical path remains sequential

DB apply → schema verification → read-only API → read-only inbox → mutation → operator workflow → AI action foundation must follow the pack sequence in §10. No API/mutation/runtime ahead of approval.

---

## 2. Cursor-first execution law

### Cursor should execute (within allowlist + gates)

When a pack prompt defines allowed files and checks, **Cursor executes everything it can safely do**:

| Action | Cursor |
|--------|--------|
| Create branch | YES |
| Inspect codebase / docs | YES |
| Edit allowed files only | YES |
| Run gate / safety checks | YES |
| Commit (when pack requests) | YES |
| Push branch | YES |
| Report with evidence | YES |

### ChatGPT decides

| Domain | Owner |
|--------|--------|
| Product direction | ChatGPT (+ founder) |
| Architecture / safety boundaries | ChatGPT |
| Pack design and prompt writing | ChatGPT |
| Report review | ChatGPT |
| PR safety decision | ChatGPT / human |
| Next pack selection | ChatGPT |

### Cursor must NOT independently do

- DB apply (`prisma migrate dev/deploy`, `prisma db push`, or any DB mutation)
- Payment capture or booking confirmation
- SOS dispatch or emergency outcome claims
- AI calling live / protected telephony actions
- API / mutation / runtime production changes outside pack allowlist
- OPERATOR role changes (Prisma / Auth)
- Production readiness claims not backed by gates and evidence
- Any change outside the pack allowlist
- Weakening gate scripts or forbidden-claims checks

**Rule:** If a task conflicts with `VIONA_OPERATING_PROTOCOL.md` or this handoff, **stop and report drift risk** — do not improvise.

---

## 3. Product kernel

### What VIONA is

**VIONA** is the **Global AI action platform** for:

- **Vietnamese abroad** — life, travel, safety, services, income, community
- **Vietnamese merchants overseas** — bookings, operations, B2B, AI reception, local marketplace

Implementation shape: **Super App / Mini-App Platform** (Companion OS), not a single vertical.

### Universes

| Universe | Role |
|----------|------|
| **Home** | LifeOS hub, loyalty, cross-universe entry |
| **Local** | Local services marketplace, requests, merchant OS |
| **Travel** | Trip companion, interpreter, transport, emergency guidance |
| **Academy** | Learning, AI teacher, credentials (honest maturity labels) |
| **Business** | Merchant / B2B / wholesale / e-shop import |
| **Account** | Profile, wallet, settings, consent |
| **SOS** | Global Lifeline — safety entry; no fake dispatch |

### Core AI / business pillars

- **AI Companion / Chat AI**
- **Voice AI**
- **Call-for-me AI**
- **Live Interpreter AI**
- **AI Receptionist**
- **AI Callback / Sales Desk**
- **AI Operator**
- **SOS Voice Guard**
- **Academy AI Teacher**
- **Travel AI Companion**
- **Request Engine** — dedicated VIONA request store (in progress; see packs)
- **Merchant Business OS**
- **Local service marketplace**

### Monetization (design targets — not all live)

Premium / credits, B2B SaaS, request fees, AI call fees, merchant subscription, future marketplace revenue. **Zero-loss mindset:** no unlimited AI subsidy; caps, audit, and honest labels until rails are live.

## 4. Safety doctrine

Non-negotiable boundaries for all packs and agents:

1. **No fake production claims** — UI and docs must not imply paid, booked, dispatched, verified, or live AI outcomes without backing systems.
2. **No direct `LocalServiceRequest` source-of-truth reuse** for the VIONA Request Engine dedicated store.
3. **No payment / booking / SOS / wallet truth encoded into request lifecycle** before governed packs unlock those domains.
4. **High-risk actions** require consent, confirmation, audit, country rules, and escalation paths.
5. **SOS** does not claim dispatch or rescue unless real legal/ops readiness exists; users must see emergency-service disclaimers.
6. **Marketing / callback calls** require consent, opt-out, audit, and no spam.
7. **AI must not impersonate the user** or silently mutate protected domains (inventory, bills, payroll, payment state).

Canonical checker: `node scripts/viona-forbidden-claims-check.mjs` (strict mode for release-sensitive docs).

## 5. Current verified master

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| Remote | `origin/master` |
| Commit | `64ccd56` |
| Message | `docs(requests): record Pack15C execution readiness decision (#82)` |
| Previous master | `70d747a` — `docs(requests): add Pack15C DB apply planning packet (#81)` |

All new work branches from `64ccd56` unless a later pack explicitly updates this handoff.

Pack15C execution readiness decision is **fully complete and green** on master. DB apply is **not performed**. DB apply remains **blocked**.

## 8. Pack15C execution readiness decision

**Decision (read-only audit):** `B) NOT READY — missing target environment / backup / restore / operator go-no-go`

Pack15B approval permits **planning only** — it is **not** execution approval. A separate execution-only pack must **not** be created or run until all missing execution inputs below are provided.

### Missing execution inputs (human/operator must provide)

1. Target environment: local / staging / production / other
2. Database provider/host confirmed outside repo
3. `DATABASE_URL` / secret confirmed outside repo, not committed
4. Named responsible execution operator
5. Execution machine/context
6. Maintenance window / user impact decision
7. Explicit execution go/no-go
8. Backup/snapshot method for chosen environment
9. Backup owner
10. Pre-apply backup timestamp evidence
11. Restore procedure for chosen environment
12. Restore test or confidence level
13. Rollback limitations
14. Restore/rollback operator
15. Distinct execution approval phrase authorizing actual `npx prisma migrate deploy` on the named target

Evidence: `docs/design/evidence/cursor-request-pack15c-execution-readiness-decision-packet/README.md`

---

## 9. Current blocked list

Still **blocked** until future approved packs and missing execution inputs are satisfied:

- DB apply
- Pack15C execution-only DB apply pack
- Pack15D DB schema verification
- Read-only persistence API (Pack16)
- Live read-only request inbox (Pack17)
- Request mutation (Pack18)
- Admin Debug live data
- OPERATOR Prisma / Auth
- Payment capture
- Booking confirmation
- SOS dispatch
- Wallet mutation
- Live AI protected actions
- Live merchant execution

---

## 10. Next sequence (critical path)

Execute in order — do not skip:

1. **Keep DB apply blocked** until human/operator provides all 15 execution inputs (§8)
2. **Optional safe docs-only handoff sync** — Pack15C kernel/handoff sync (this pack)
3. **Optional safe UI/design/read-only audit lanes** — no DB/runtime/API/mutation drift
4. **Pack15C execution-only DB apply pack** — only after all execution inputs and execution approval phrase are provided
5. **Pack15D** — DB schema verification (only after successful DB apply)
6. **Pack16** — Read-only persistence API
7. **Pack17** — Live read-only request inbox
8. **Pack18** — Request mutation
9. **Pack19** — Merchant / operator workflow
10. **Pack20+** — AI request assistant / AI action foundation

---

## 11. Parallel lanes (low risk)

May run in parallel when allowlisted and gate-clean:

- Docs / kernel / handoff updates (including this handoff)
- Read-only audits
- Product specs
- Evidence docs
- UI polish packs that avoid DB/runtime/API/mutation and preserve existing routes
- Design evidence cleanup
- i18n copy safety review
- Non-runtime planning packets
- AI product contracts
- GTM / business docs
- Country launch matrix
- Consent / do-not-call / audit policies

### Forbidden safe-lane drift

- No broad refactor
- No architecture rewrite
- No DB apply
- No Prisma schema/migration edits
- No API/mutation implementation
- No payment/booking/SOS/wallet truth changes
- No fake production claims
- No OPERATOR Prisma/Auth changes
- No live AI protected action unlocks

---

## 12. Stop list (hard stops)

Stop immediately and report if asked to:

- Apply DB before all 15 execution inputs (§8) and a separate execution-only pack are authorized
- Run any of: `prisma migrate dev`, `prisma migrate deploy`, `prisma migrate status`, `prisma db push`, `prisma db execute`, or any command that connects to or mutates a database (outside an authorized execution-only pack with confirmed environment and backup/restore)
- Add API or mutation ahead of Pack16–18 sequence
- Add OPERATOR role ahead of pack
- Enable live AI call, SOS, payment, or booking ahead of gates
- Make broad unrelated repo changes during a narrow pack
- Weaken gate scripts, allowlists, or forbidden-claims checks
- Claim production/live behavior in docs or UI without evidence

---

## Quick start for a new session

1. Read this file and `docs/ai-context/VIONA_OPERATING_PROTOCOL.md`.
2. Confirm baseline: `git rev-parse origin/master` → expect `64ccd56` until updated.
3. Read the active pack prompt allowlist and forbidden list.
4. Branch from `origin/master`; run gates before commit.
5. Cursor executes; ChatGPT reviews report and PR safety.
